- **Top-Selling Pizzas:** The **Classic Deluxe Pizza** and **Barbecue Chicken Pizza** consistently ranked among the top sellers, highlighting customer preference for premium flavors.  
- **Category-Wise Revenue:** The **Classic** and **Supreme** categories generated the maximum revenue, suggesting they should be prioritized in marketing campaigns.  
- **Least-Selling Pizzas:** **Brie Carre Pizza** and **Mediterranean Veggie Pizza** had the lowest sales, indicating potential candidates for recipe revision or removal.  
- **Order Size Trend:** The majority of customers preferred **large-sized pizzas**, contributing significantly to total sales volume.  
- **Daily Sales Pattern:** Sales tend to drop midweek (Tuesday‚ÄìWednesday), providing an opportunity to introduce **midweek combo offers** to increase orders.  
- **Revenue Insights:** Around **65% of total revenue** comes from repeat customers, emphasizing the importance of maintaining high service quality and loyalty programs.
